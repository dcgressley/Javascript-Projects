#### Pizza Menu

A simple menu used to order a pizza with a number of optional toppings. Total price is calculated from the topping inputs.

#### Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple game of tic-tac-toe. It is the user versus the "computer" with the player taking the first turn, and the loser taking the first turn in the following game each time. The computer player randomly selects a move from the available squares and the winner is celebrated with sound and a visual.

#### Calculator

A basic 4 function calculator. Users can add, subtract, multiply and divide on a simple, clean calculator on the web.
